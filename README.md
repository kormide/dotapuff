# About DotaPuff
DotaPuff is a toy project that I created to help me learn
Node.js. It gathers statistics from your recent DOTA 2
matches and shows a side-by-side comparison of your
performance compared to your recent peers.

Occasionally you'll get an error saying that the steam servers
are busy. Just wait a few minutes and try again. Gathering
the necessary data requires many calls to the DOTA 2 web api,
so loading can be a little slow.
