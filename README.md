# About DotaPuff
DotaPuff gathers a list of peers you've recently played with
(or against) and compares your performance along various
metrics over your last 50 games. The arrows to the left and
right of each user will place them into left or right
slots of the comparison view, where you can see a graph
of performance over time. To change the user, enter the
steam ID into the search bar and click the search button.

Occasionally you'll get an error saying that the steam servers
are busy. Just wait a few minutes and try again. Gathering
the necessary data requires many calls to the DOTA 2 web api,
so loading can be a little slow.
